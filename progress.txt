## 2026-01-05: Center Magnified Hexagram on Screen

### Status
Complete - hexagram now vertically centers when magnified after casting all 6 lines.

### Changes
- Modified `src/screens/CastingScreen.tsx` to calculate and animate a `translateY` offset when the hexagram is magnified
- The centering calculates the available screen height (minus top padding) and moves the hexagram card to the center
- Animation syncs with the existing scale animation (700ms delay, 500ms duration)

### Technical Details
- Available height = screenHeight - 60 (top padding)
- Target center = availableHeight / 2
- Current card center = hexagramTopMargin + 170 (half of container height)
- TranslateY offset animates the difference to center the card

### Notes
- The View Reading button and Start Over link remain attached below the hexagram and move with it
- Coins slide out left before centering begins, freeing up the bottom of the screen
